# Theme Creator

A Voiden plugin for creating, editing, and live-previewing custom color themes — all without leaving the app.

## Overview

Theme Creator adds a full-featured theme editor directly inside Voiden. Pick colors for every UI token, see your changes applied instantly, and save themes that persist across app restarts.

## Getting Started

Click the **Themes** button in the right side of the status bar to open the Theme Creator panel.

## Features

### Browse & Manage Themes
- View all your custom themes in the sidebar with a live mini-preview of each
- Edit or delete any custom theme at any time
- Import themes from `.json` files shared by others
- Export any theme as a `.json` file to share or back up

### Create Custom Themes
- Start from a **Dark** or **Light** base template with sensible defaults
- Full color picker for every token — background, surface, text, border, accent, status, syntax, ANSI, HTTP method colors, and more
- Accent RGB triplets (`--accent-rgb`, `--accent-alt-rgb`) are auto-derived whenever you pick an accent color
- Collapsible color sections keep the editor organized: Base, Accent, Status, Syntax

### Live Preview
- Hit **Try Live** while editing to instantly apply your in-progress theme to the running app
- Hit **Restore** to revert back to your saved theme at any time
- When you save, the app automatically reverts to whichever theme was active in your settings

### Theme Storage
- Custom themes are saved as JSON files in your Voiden user data directory (`userData/themes/`)
- Themes persist across app restarts automatically

## Color Tokens Covered
